# guessGame
Created a guessing game of random numbers with upper and lower bound with certain difficulty levels.
<br>
The main file of the code is contained inside of the directory "src/co/sohamds/guessGame/"
<br>
<p>
The guessGame repo has two directories with different functionalities.
<br>
One for the production- "out/production/begin/co/sohamds/guessGame/"
and one which contains all the source code- "src/co/sohamds/guessGame/"
<br>
</p>

<p>
The code can be used for any research purpose and can be modified
<br> with no hesitation. Also, I would love to merge any of the
changes that improves the code and readability of the whole project.

Thank you for your time to look at the code and happy coding.
